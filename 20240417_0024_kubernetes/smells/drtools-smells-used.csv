"Too Large Package/Subsystem","Packages/Subsystems with a high number of classes/packages indicate that they serve more than one specific responsibility","NAMESPACE","Normal","Planned","Understandability, Modularity"
"Cyclic Dependency","This smell occurs when two or more packages/subsystems depend on each other","NAMESPACE","High","Normal","Coupling, Modularity"
"God Class","This smell is huge, complex, and has an extremely high number of fields and methods","TYPE","High","Planned","Understandability, Maintainability"
"Broken Modularization","This smell arises when data and/or methods that ideally should have been localized into a single abstraction are separated and spread across multiple abstractions","TYPE","Low","Planned","Modularity, Maintainability"
"Insufficient Modularization","This smell arises when an abstraction exists that has not been completely decomposed, and a further decomposition could reduce its size, implementation complexity, or both","TYPE","Normal","Planned","Modularity, Maintainability"
"Hub-like Modularization","This smell arises when an abstraction has dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions","TYPE","High","Planned","Maintainability, Coupling"
"Cyclically-dependent Modularization","This smell arises when two or more abstractions depend on each other directly or indirectly","TYPE","High","Normal","Modularity"
"Multifaceted Abstraction","This smell arises when an abstraction has more than one responsibility assigned to it","TYPE","Normal","Planned","Cohesion"
"Deep Hierarchy","This smell arises when an inheritance hierarchy is 'excessively' deep","TYPE","Normal","Planned","Inheritance"
"Wide Hierarchy","This smell arises when an inheritance hierarchy is 'too' wide indicating that intermediate types may be missing","TYPE","Normal","Planned","Inheritance"
"Deficient Encapsulation","This smell occurs when the declared accessibility of one or more members of an abstraction is more permissive than actually required","TYPE","Normal","Planned","Encapsulation"
